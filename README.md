Computer Scientists - According to the Michigan Tech University's website, "Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to computer science" (Michigan Technological University, 2022).
